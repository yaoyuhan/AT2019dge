\section{Introduction}
The physical origin of the population of subluminous fast-evolving supernovae (SNe) still remains 
largely elusive. Their light curves have been explained by low ejecta mass ($\lesssim 0.5M_\odot$) 
explosions that produce a small amount ($\lesssim 0.1M_\odot$) of radioactive material 
\citep{Shen2010, Sim2012, Moriya2017, Polin2019}, interaction with an stellar envelop or circumstellar 
material (CSM) (e.g. \citealt{KleiserKasen2018, Piro2015}), or even powered by alternative power 
sources, such as an internal engine (e.g. \citealt{Hotokezaka2017}). See \citet{Kasen2017} for a review.

Today, a growing number of SNe are detected within one or two days of the explosion, opening a new 
window into the relatively unexplored early phase of these events. Here we report observations of the 
rapidly evolving subluminous SN AT2019dge discovered by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF; 
\citealt{Bellm2019b}; 
\citealt{Graham2019}), along with modeling of the bolometric lightcurve and early spectra, and a 
discussion of plausible explosion scenarios of this object.

Calculations in this paper assume a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology with $H_0= 70 \, \rm km \, s^{-1}\, 
Mpc^{-1}$, $\Omega_m = 0.27$ and $\Omega_{\Lambda} = 0.73$ \citep{Komatsu2011}. UT times are 
used throughout the paper. Alongside this paper, we have released our open-source analysis and all of 
the data utilized in this study. These are available online at 
\url{https://github.com/yaoyuhan/AT2019dge}. All spectra and photometry will also be made available 
by the WISeREP repository \citep{Yaron2012}.

AT2019dge was first detected by ZTF using the Palomar Oschin Schmidt 48 inch (P48) telescope in a 
one-day cadence experiment. On 2019 April 7 10:18:46 (JD 
$=2458580.9297$), a $g$-band detection at $20.66\pm0.34$ mag and J2000 coordinates $\alpha = 
17^{\mathrm{h}}36^{\mathrm{m}}46.75^{\mathrm{s}}$, $\delta = 
+50^{\mathrm{d}}32^{\mathrm{m}}52.2^{\mathrm{s}}$
%$\alpha = 17^{\mathrm{h}}36^{\mathrm{m}}46.76^{\mathrm{s}}$, $\delta = 
%+50^{\mathrm{d}}32^{\mathrm{m}}52.5^{\mathrm{s}}$ (J2000) 
met the machine-learning thresholds \citep{Mahabal2019} and real-time alerts were generated 
\citep{Patterson2019}. On April 8, the 
transient was flagged by a science program filter on the GROWTH Marshal \citep{Kasliwal2019} that is 
designed to look for fast evolving transients (Ho et al., in prep). 

AT2019dge is consistent with being at the nucleus of a compact galaxy at the redshift of $z=0.0213$ 
(Appendix \ref{app:spec}). Figure~\ref{fig:detection} shows the detection image on April 10. 
 
\subsection{Photometry}

\subsubsection{Optical Photometry} \label{subsubsec:opt_phot}
We perform forced PSF photometry on ZTF difference images following the steps illustrated in 
\citet{Yao2019}. 
%As is mentioned in \citet{Yao2019}, forced photometry provides better constrains on the 
%pre-explosion limits as well as deeper late-time photometry by binning the flux measurements taken 
%at 
%the same night \todo{Is forced photometry the same as binning the flux, or are they separate?  As 
%written implies they are the same -reword? -esp}.
%We fix the position by using the median of all 5$\sigma$ detection coordinates (), which is more 
%accurate than the coordinate of the first detection. 
The sky region of AT2019dge is covered by two ZTF fields with fieldid 763 and 
1799. We exclude all data in field 1799 since the reference image was constructed using images 
obtained between May 25 2018 and July 12 2019, which is after the explosion of the 
transient\footnote{The ZTF name (ZTF18abfcmjw) indicates that the transient was discovered in 2018. 
However, this is due to a candidate detection from negative subtraction (ref minus sci) in 2018 in field 
1799.}.

Since field 763 was included in both the northern sky survey with two epochs (one 
$g\, +$ one $r$) per three nights and the extragalactic high-cadence survey with six epochs (three 
$g\,+$ three $r$) per night\footnote{See \citet{Bellm2019a} for the ZTF experiments design.}, this 
transient are visited muliple times every night. Therefore, single-night flux measurements in the same 
filter are binned (by taking the inverse variance-weighted 
average), which gives a pre-explosion $r$-band limit of 18.95 mag (5$\sigma$ limit computed at the 
expected position of the transient) on April 4 10:36:34. Five-$\sigma$ detections are converted to 
magnitude for further analysis.

Following the discovery of AT2019dge, we obtained follow-up photometry in $griz$ with the optical 
imager (IO:O) on the Liverpool Telescope (LT; \citealt{Steele2004}). LT and P48 photometry are shown 
in Figure~\ref{fig:lightcurve}. Absolute magnitude is determined 
by correcting for the distance modulus and Galactic extinction $E(B-V)=0.022$ estimated by 
\citet{Schlafly2011}, which builds upon \citet{Schlegel1998}. We assume $R_V=3.1$, and adopt
reddening law from \citet{Cardelli1989}. We do not correct for host-galaxy contamination given the 
absence of \ion{Na}{I} D absorption in all spectra at the host redshift. 

We also performed forced photometry on archival PTF/iPTF difference images spanning May 07 2009 to 
June 13 2016\footnote{We followed the procedure described in 
	\url{http://web.ipac.caltech.edu/staff/fmasci/home/miscscience/forcedphot.pdf}}. No historical 
detections was found. 

\subsubsection{Swift Photometry}
 
Space-based observations with the \textit{Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory} (\textit{Swift}; 
\citealt{Gehrels2004}) was triggered on April 9 and April 10. Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope (UVOT; 
\citealt{Roming2005}) data were obtained in the $UVW1$, $UVM2$, $UVW2$, $U$, $B$, and $V$ 
filters. 

UVOT data are reduced using HEAsoft (v6.17) with a $3^{\prime\prime}$ circular aperture. To remove 
host-galaxy contribution at the location of 
the SN, we obtained a final epoch in all broad-band filters on June 23 2019 and measured the 
photometry with the same aperture used for the transient. 

We note that no point sources were detected in the XRT event files with $\rm{SNR}>2$.

\subsubsection{Radio Follow-up}
We observed at high frequency radio bands using the Submillimeter Array (SMA, \citealt{Ho2004}) on 
UT 2019 xx xx under its target-of-opportunity program. The project ID was xxx. Obser


\subsection{Spectroscopy}

We obtained seven optical spectroscopic follow-up of AT2019dge  starting from $-10$\,d to $+53$\,d 
after $r$-band peak using the Rapid Acquisition of Transients (SPRAT; \citealt{Piascik2014}) on the 
Liverpool Telescope (LT), the Double Spectrograph (DBSP) on the 200-inch Hale telescope 
\citep{Oke1982}, and the Low Resolution Imaging Spectrograph (LRIS) on the Keck-I telescope 
\citep{Oke1995}. We present our sequence of spectra in Figure~\ref{fig:spectra}. 

We use the automated LT pipeline reduction and extraction for the LT spectra. LRIS spectra were 
reduced and extracted using \texttt{Lpipe} \citep{Perley2019lpipe}. The DBSP spectrum was reduced 
using a \texttt{PyRAF}-based reduction pipeline \citep{Bellm2016}.

\todo{HST UV Spectroscopy}
G280 grism

70@300nm and an average dispersion of about 1.3 nm per pixel

Since there is no detectable \ion{Na}{I} D lines in any of our spectra and the object is very blue, we 
assume throughout the analysis that the host extinction along the line of sight is negligible.


\section{Basic Properties of the Explosion \\and its Host Galaxy}
\subsection{Light Curve Properties}\label{subsec:lc_properties}

To estimate the epoch of maximum light, we interpolated the $g$- and $r$-band photometry with 
three-order polynomial functions, as is shown in the inset of Figure~\ref{fig:lightcurve}. The time range 
used in the fit is from ${\rm MJD}=58581.2$ to $58585.2$. AT2019dge was found to peak 
at $M_{g, \rm max}=-16.45\pm0.04$ mag on ${\rm MJD}=58583.19$, and $M_{r, \rm 
max}=-16.27\pm0.02$ mag on ${\rm MJD}=58583.39$. Hereafter we use $\Delta t$ to denote time
with respect to the $g$-band maximum light epoch, ${\rm MJD}=58583.2$, and use $t$ to denote time 
from the assumed explosion epoch (MJD = xx measured from Section xx).

We constructed the bolometric light curve evolution by fitting a blackbody function to the spectral 
energy distribution (SED). At eighteen epochs where at least detections in three flters are available, we 
utilized the Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) simulations with \texttt{emcee} 
\citep{Foreman-Mackey2013} and adopted wide and flat prior for the blackbody radius and 
temperature ($0<T_{\rm bb}<10^6$\,K, $0<R_{\rm bb}<10^6\,R_\odot$). Uncertainties are estimated 
using the difference between the 84th and the 16th percentiles of posterior probability distributions. At 
five epochs that we only have photometric observations in two filters, we fit for $T_{\rm bb}$ and 
$R_{\rm bb}$ with no estimates on the parameter uncetainties. The SED fits are shown in 
\ref{app:phot} and the resulting evolution in bolometric lumonosity, photospheric radius, 
and effective temperatures is listed in Table  \ref{tab:bbfit}. 

Adopting the explosion epoch estimated in Section \ref{subsec:shock} at $\Delta t=-3.3$\,d (i.e., 
0.56\,d before the discovery epoch), we plot the physical evolution in Figure~\ref{fig:Tbb_Rbb_Lbb}, 
with a comparison to iPTF14gqr and ZTF18aalrxas. The bolometric luminosity peaks at $ t=1$--2\,d 
after the assumed explosion epoch, at $\sim 5\times 10^{42}\,{\rm erg\, s^{-1}}$. The initial fast drop of 
luminsity ($0.36\,{\rm mag\,d^{-1}}$) and temperature is similar to the early evolution of several 
stripped envelope SNe IIb displaying double-peaked light curve, where the first peak has been modelled 
by cooling emission from an extended envelope around the progenitor after the core-collapse SN 
shock breaks out (e.g., SN2016gkg, \citealt{Arcavi2017}; ZTF18aalrxas, \citealt{Fremling2019}). We 
interpret the early evolution in the context of shock-cooling emission in Section \ref{subsec:shock}.

The lumnosity falls as an exponential at late times ($ t \gtrsim 10$\,d) while the radius remains flat, and 
even appears to recede. The total integrated blackbody energy output during $ t = 0.6$--30\,d is $\sim 
2\times 10^{43}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$. Assuming that the photospheric radius linearly expands at early 
phase, we fit a linear function to the $R_{\rm bb}$ vs.~$\Delta t$ diagram (bottom panel of 
Figure~\ref{fig:Tbb_Rbb_Lbb}).

The very early spectra at $-1.1$, $-0.1$, and $+0.4$\,d show a blue continuum and strong galaxy 
emision lines from the underlying \ion{H}{II} region (see Figure~\ref{fig:spectra_early}). In addition. 
these spectra also show prominent high-ionization \ion{He}{II} $\lambda4686$ narrow emission that 
later disappear. No broad 
lines are seem....

These lines were created by recombination of some CSM flash-ionized by a shock breakout 
\citep{Khazov2016} . \todo{Ask Avishay

\todo{Using the line index definition given by \citet{Khazov2016}, we calculated the equivalent width of 
\ion{He}{II} to be $-7.56\pm 1.07$ $-2.66\pm 1.30$, and $-3.77\pm 0.16$ in the $-1.1$\,d, $-0.1$\,d,

		\label{fig:hst_opt}}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Photosperic Spectral Evolution}
Broad transient features show up in the $+12.0$ adn $+14.3$\,d spectra. The existence of P-Cygni 
\ion{He}{I} $\lambda5876$ profile and non-existence of hydrogen is reminiscent of Type Ib 
SN. The HST spectrum should contain little host-galaxy contamination due to its narrow 
slitwidth and high resolution, otherwise we should see emission features at prominent galaxy line 
wavelengths (H$\alpha$, [\ion{O}{III}], [\ion{O}{II}], etc). The UV part is much weaker than a blackbody 
extrapolation opf their optical spectra would predict. This has also been seen in previous UV 
observations of SNe, and interpreted as strong metal-line blanketing, mostly by \ion{Fe}{II} and 
\ion{Co}{II} lines \citep{Gal-Yam2008}.

\todo{say that the undulations at 6700\AA is likely just noise. Ask David to put a trace on the galaxy 
center and show spectrum to get a sense of the SNR}

		\citep{Yan2017}.
		\label{fig:hst_all}}
\end{figure}

In Figure~\ref{fig:hst_opt} we show that AT2019dge share similarity with those of normal SNe Ib/IIb in 
the optical region, but the spectrum does not match any known SN in 4000-4500\AA\,and 
6500--7500\AA. In Figure~\ref{fig:hst_all} we compare the HST UV spectrum too other type of SN. 
AT2019dge most closely resemble SN1993J between 2000 and 4000\AA. .

At $+12$\,d, the velocity of the \ion{He}{I} $\lambda5876$ line is $\sim7000\, {\rm km\,s^{-1}}$ 
(Figure~\ref{fig:HeI_dbsp}); At maximum light, we expect the photospheric velocity to be higher. A 
linear fit to the first few $R_{\rm bb}$ vs. time measurements (lower panel of Figure 
\ref{fig:Tbb_Rbb_Lbb}) gives $v_{\rm ej}\sim 10,000\, {\rm km\,s^{-1}}$.

\subsubsection{Late-time  Spectral Evolution}
In our late time spectrum obtained at $+85.3$, $+143.1$ and $+171.1$\,d, we observe narrow emission 
lines that are typically the most prominent features of SNe Ib/c at nebular epochs. The emission feature 
at $\sim6300$\AA\,is regularly attributed to [\ion{O}{I}] $\lambda\lambda$6300, 6364 
\citep{Maedo2008}

\ion{O}{I}, \ion{Ca}{II} and \ion{He}{I} lines. 
This feature is , and  (e.g., Maeda et al. 2008; Taubenberger et al. 
2009). The presence or absence of this feature has often been considered the sharpest observational 
discrimination between core-collapse and thermonuclear SNe (e.g., Filippenko 1997). 
the [O i] λλ6300, 6364 feature consists of two similarly strong, fairly narrow emission peaks on top of 
a broad base (figure blah blah)

Both these transients share similarities in that they exhibit signs of interaction with H-poor 
circumstellar material (CSM) after peak, and may be the likely candidates for low energy explosions in 
dense H-poor CSM (e.g. \citealt{KleiserFuller2018, KleiserKasen2018}).

\subsection{SN location and Host Galaxy Properties}
\begin{figure}

	\caption{The position of AT2019dge (red crosshairs) in its host galaxy.
		Images are combined using the prescription in \citet{Lupton2004}.
		\label{fig:offset}}
\end{figure}
In Figure~\ref{fig:offset}, we show the source position on the image from the Beijing-Arizona Sky 
Survey(BASS, \citealt{Zou2017}), which is part of the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys \citep{Dey2019}. 
Using the re-centered transient position reported in Section \ref{subsubsec:opt_phot}, we calculated 
that AT2019dge is $0.14^{\prime\prime}$ (0.06\,kpc) away from the galaxy nucleus, which is defined to 
be the flux-weighted first 
moment of the BASS $g$-band image.

Since there was no pre-explosion spectrum of the host galaxy, we estimated the host flux 
by fitting a synthetic galaxy spectrum with SDSS model magnitudes (van Velzen et al. 2019). To 
perform subtraction of the host flux, we calibrated the flux level in each optical spectrum against ZTF 
$r$-band photometry, interpolated to the spectroscopic epochs. We then convolved the synthetic 
host galaxy spectrum with a Gaussian kernel to account for instrumental broadening and subtracted 
the broadened, synthetic spectrum from our observed spectra. A montage of the host-subtracted 
spectra is shown in Figure \ref{fig:spectra}. The flux is normalized to the 5500–6000 A ̊ region in rest 
wavelength and offset from each other for better visualization.

In Fig we shoulw the SED of xx, which was compiled from Swfit/UVOT, SDSS, and catalogs and 

We measure the metallicity of the host galaxy using  the spectrum xx. 

We infer a star-formation rate of $0.10 \pm 0.02 \, M_\odot\, {\rm yr^{-1}}$ from the H$\alpha$ 
emission line using the \citet{Kennicutt1998} relation converted to use a Chabrier initial mass function 
\citep{Chabrier2003, Madau2014}. 

We also compute the oxygen abundance using the strong-line metallicity indicator N2 
\citep{Pettini2004} with the updated calibration reported in \citet{Marino2013}. The oxygen abundance 
in the N2 scale is 8.23 $\pm$ 0.01 (stat) $\pm$ 0.05 (sys).

It is worth noting that while several 
previously reported events (SN\,2005ek, SN\,2010X, iPTF\,14gqr) and SN\,2018kzr were found in star 
forming host galaxies, SN\,2019bkc stands out as a hostless transient offset by tens of kpc from any 
likely host (see Table \ref{tab:compare}).

\subsection{Rise and Decline timescales}

\begin{figure}[htbp!]

	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/compare_mag.pdf}
	\caption{Comparison of the photometric evolution timescales ($\tau_{\rm rise}$ and $\tau_{\rm

		\label{fig:compare_mag}}
\end{figure}

To characterize the rise and decline timescales of AT2019dge, we calculate rise time ($\tau_{\rm rise}$) 
defined by how long it takes the $r$-band light curve to rise from one magnitude below peak to peak, 
and decline time ($\tau_{\rm decay}$) determined by how long it takes to decline from peak by one 
magnitude. Figure \ref{fig:compare_mag} shows the comparison of maximum light absolute magnitude 
corrected for Galactic extinction ($M_{r/R}$), $\tau_{\rm rise}$ and $\tau_{\rm decay}$ between 
AT2019dge and other fast-evolving hydrogen-deficient transients. The peak luminosity of AT2019dge 
is lower than normal SNe Ib ($M_R\approx -17.9\pm0.9$\,mag, \citealt{Drout2011}) but consistent with 
those of the Ca-rich gap transients (e.g., PTF09dav and PTF10iuv shown in 
Figure~\ref{fig:compare_mag}), which occupy the luminosity `gap' between novae and SNe (peak 
absolute magnitude $M_R \approx -15.5$ to $-16.5$\,mag).

We conclude that AT2019dge exhibits unique differences in light curve shape (faintest $r$-band peak 
magnitude, greatest $\tau_{\rm decay}$ and the smallest $\tau_{\rm rise}$) within this set of fast 
evolving Type I events.

\subsection{Color Evolution}
\begin{figure*}[htbp!]
	\centering
	    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/compare_color.pdf}
	\caption{Comparison of the color evolution of AT2019dge with some other fast SNe shown in 
	Figure~\ref{fig:compare_mag}. All colors have been corrected for Galactic extincton. Due to absence 
	of photometry in identical filters, we compare colors in corresponding filter pairs of $B$/$g$, 
	$R$/$r$ and 
	$I$/$i$. \label{fig:compare_color}}
\end{figure*}

We compare the color curves of other fast transients to that of AT2019dge in 
Figure~\ref{fig:compare_color}, in corresponding pairs of $B$/$g-R$/$r$ and $R$/$r-I$/$i$ colors. The 
early-time blue color of AT2019dge arises from the high-temperature peak. Subsequently, AT2019dge 
has relatively typical $g-r$ color evolution among this set of transients, displaying a 
progression from a very blue transient ($g-r \approx -0.4$ mag) at early times to a relatively red 
transient ($g-r \approx 0.5$) within 10 days of explosion. This fast reddening is indicative of rapid 
cooling of the ejecta since the spectra at these phases are broadly consistent with featureless 
continua. We conclude that the multi-color light curves of the main peak of iPTF 14gqr exhibit several 
similarities (light curve shape and timescales) as well as unique differences (short rise time) in this 
sample of transients.

AT2019dge shows a color starting out blue and turning redder with time, consistent with an expanding 
and cooling photosphere.

Although AT2019dge has the same optical peak luminsity as Ca-rich transients, their multi-color light 
curves of are very different in shape. The color evolution  which otherwise form a fairly homogeneous 
class. 

\todo{AT2019dge is special in that the color even turned green a littble bit at $6<\Delta t<10$.}

We 
also searched for analogues of AT2019dge in samples of rapidly evolving events at high-redshift, 
including Pan-STARRS1 Medium Deep Survey (PS1-MDS. \citealt{Drout2014}) and the Dark Energy 
Survey (DES \citealt{Pursiainen2018}).

\subsection{Spectroscopy}

Although there is a large diversity in the properties of these events, most of them can be 
grouped into events that are similar to thermonuclear SNe (e.g. PTF09dav, \citealt{Sullivan2011}; 
OGLE-2013-SN-079, \citealt{Inserra2015}; SN2016hnk, \citealt{Galbany2019, Jacobson-Galan2019}) 
likely arising from old white dwarfs, and those similar to Type Ib/c SNe (SN\,2002bj, 
\citealt{Poznanski2010}; SN\,2005ek, \citealt{Drout2013}; SN\,2010X, \citealt{Kasliwal2010}; iPTF\,14gqr, 
\citealt{De2018}) possibly arising from extremely stripped massive stars or white dwarfs in close binary 
systems.

Ca-rich transients have detectable [O I] λλ6300, 6364 emission in nebular spectra, but a defining 
feature of the class is an integrated [Ca II]/[O I] flux ratio greater than ∼2.

\section{Interpretation}
\subsection{Radioactivity-powered SN} \label{subsec:radioactivity}
SNe light cuves are mainly powered by shock energy or radiative diffusion from a heating 
source. If the observed rise in bolometric luminsity is due to a diffusion process, we can estimate the 
ejecta mass ($M_{\rm ej}$) of AT2019dge from its rise time ($t_{\rm peak}$). \citet[][hereafter 
KK19]{Khatami2019} shows that (Eq.~23 of KK19):
\begin{align}
    \frac{t_{\rm peak}}{t_{\rm d}} = 0.11\,{\rm ln} \left( 1 + \frac{9t_s}{t_d} \right)+ 0.36. \label{eq:kk19_23}
\end{align}
Here $t_{\rm peak}$ is not sensitive to the specific formula of the heating function, but depends on the heating timescale ($t_s$), the spacial distribution of mixing, and the characteristic diffusion timescale expressed by
\begin{align}
    t_d = \sqrt{\frac{\kappa M_{\rm ej}}{v_{\rm ej}c}}, \label{eq:kk19_12}
\end{align}
where $v_{\rm ej}$ is the ejecta velocity. Eq.~(\ref{eq:kk19_23}) implies that as $t_s/t_d$ increases from 
$10^{-2}$ to $10^2$, $t_{\rm peak}/t_d$ only varies in a small range (from 0.4 to 1, Fig.~6 of KK19). 
Assuming $t_{\rm peak}\approx 2\,{\rm d}$, $v_{\rm ej}\approx 7000\,{\rm km\, s^{-1}}$, and $\kappa 
\sim 0.1\, {\rm cm^2\,g^{-1}}$, $t_d$ is roughly 2.3--5.4\,d. Using Eq.~(\ref{eq:kk19_12}), $M_{\rm ej}$ is 
estimated to be 0.004--0.023\,$M_{\odot}$. 

We first examine if the peak of AT2019dge is likely to be powered by the radioactive decay of $^{56}\rm 
Ni \rightarrow ^{56}Co \rightarrow ^{56}Fe$. The energy deposition rate is
\begin{align}
    \varepsilon_{\rm rad} =
    &\varepsilon_{\rm Ni, \gamma} (t) + \varepsilon_{\rm Co, \gamma} (t)  \; {\rm [erg\,g^{-1}\,s^{-1}]}\\
 \varepsilon_{\rm Ni, \gamma} (t)   =& 3.9 \times 10^{10} e^{-t/t_{s, {\rm Ni}}}  \\
\varepsilon_{\rm Co, \gamma} (t)     &= 7\times 10^{9} \left( e^{-t/t_{s, {\rm Co}}} - e^{-t/t_{s, {\rm Ni}}}\right)
\end{align}
where $t_{s, {\rm Ni}}=8.8$\,d and $t_{s, {\rm Co}}=111.3$\,d are the decay lifetimes of $^{56}\rm Ni$ and $^{56}\rm Co$ \citep{Nadyozhin1994}. The effective heating rate is modified by the probability of thermalization, and thus $\varepsilon_{\rm heat} \leq \varepsilon_{\rm rad}$.

For $^{56}\rm Ni$ powered explosions, the bolometric light curve can be generally divided into the photospheric phase and the nebula phase. Early observations at the photospheric phase are commonly used to constrain parameters such as the explosion epoch, the total nickle mass ($M_{\rm Ni}$) and the explosion energy. Recently, KK19 presents improved analytic relations (compared with the original \citealt{Arnett1982} model) between $t_{\rm peak}$ and $L_{\rm peak}$. When $t<10$\,d, $\varepsilon_{\rm Ni}(t) \gg \varepsilon_{\rm Co}(t)$, and thus we have an exponential heating function 
\begin{equation}
    L_{\rm heat}(t) = L_0 e^{-t/t_{s, {\rm Ni}}}
\end{equation}
where $L_0 = M_{\rm Ni}\cdot \varepsilon_{\rm Ni, \gamma}$. In this case, KK19 (Eq.~21) shows that the 
relation between peak time and luminosity is:
\begin{equation}
    L_{\rm peak} = \frac{2L_0 t_s^2}{\beta^2 t_{\rm peak}^2} \left[ 1 - (1 + \beta t_{\rm peak}/t_s ) e^{-\beta t_
    {\rm peak}/ t_s} \right]
\end{equation}
where $\beta \sim 4/3$ gives a reasonable match to numerical simulations. Adopting $L_{\rm 
peak}\approx 5\times 10^{42}\,{\rm erg \, s^{-1}}$, we get an estimate of $M_{\rm Ni}\sim 
0.08 M_{\odot}$. Since $M_{\rm ej}$ is much smaller than the nickle mass needed to 
power the peak luminosity, we conclude that the peak of AT2019dge is not powered by radioactivity. 

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/Lbb.pdf}
	\caption{Bolometric light curve for AT2019dge. The quasi-bolometric light curve of AT2019dge 
	estimated by computing $\nu L_\nu$ in $r$-band is shown as emply circles.}
	\label{fig:Lbb}
\end{figure}

Next, we examine wheter the late time light curve can be powered by $^{56}\rm Ni$ decay. At the 
nebula phase the SN ejecta becomes optically thin, such that the delay between the energy deposition 
from radioactivity and the optical radiation becomes shorter. The bolometric luminosity is then equal to 
the rate of energy deposition: $L_{\rm bol}(t) = Q(t)$. At any given time, the energy deposition rate 
$Q(t)$ is \citep{Wygoda2019}:
\begin{align*}
    Q(t) = Q_{\gamma}(t)\left( 1 - e^{-(t_0/t)^2}\right) + Q_{\rm pos}(t),
\end{align*}
where $Q_{\gamma}(t) = M_{\rm Ni}\varepsilon_{\rm rad}$ is the energy release rate of gamma-rays and $t_0$ is the time at which the ejecta becomes optically thin to gamma rays. $Q_{\rm pos}(t)$ is the energy deposition rate of positron kinetic energy:
\begin{align}
Q_{\rm pos}(t) &= M_{\rm Ni}\varepsilon_{\rm Co, pos}(t)\\
    \varepsilon_{\rm Co, pos}(t) &=  2.3\times 10^{8} \left( e^{-t/t_{s, {\rm Co}}} - e^{-t/t_{s, {\rm Ni}}}\right)
\end{align}

In Figure~\ref{fig:Lbb}, bolometric light curve measured in Section \ref{subsec:lc_properties} are shown 
in black. We also show late-time $r$-band $\nu L_{\nu}$ measurements in grey empty circles as a 
proxy of bolometric light curve evolution. Model tracks with $t_0 = 40$\,d and $M_{\rm Ni} =0.004$, 
0.008, and 0.02$M_\odot$ are plotted in blue lines. From Figure~\ref{fig:Lbb}, it is evident that the late 
time `tail' can be explained by a continuing input of decay energy with $M_{\rm Ni}\sim 0.008 M_\odot$ 
and $t_0~40$\,d. 

Assuming that radioactivity dominates the light curve after the initial abrupt drop of bolometric 
luminosity ($t>10$\,d). If the nebula phase starts 20--25 days after explosion, we use the above 
equations to constrain model parameters to be $M_{\rm Ni} = 
0.008 \pm 0.001 \,M_\odot$ and $t_0 = 39.0^{+4.5}_{-4.7}$\,days. The photospheric phase can be 
modelled using Equations given in \citet[][Appendix A]{Valenti2008}, with modifications given by 
\citet[][Eq.~3]{Lyman2016}, where the light curve shape is determined by $M_{\rm Ni}$ and the photon 
diffusion time $\tau_{\rm m}$. In Figure~\ref{fig:Lbb} we overplot this photospheric model fit by eye in 
dotted cyan line. We are unable to achieve an excellent match to data between $t=10$\,d and 
$t=20$\,d. This may be explained by inaccuracy of the Arnett solution, but more likely due to other 
emission mechanisms contributing a non-negligible amount of radiation at this early phase.

\subsection{Shock Cooling Emisssion} \label{subsec:shock}
We model the early light curve as cooling emission from shock-heated extended material using models 
presented by \citet[][hereafter P15]{Piro2015} to constrain the mass and radius of the extanded material
($M_{\rm ent}$ and $R_{\rm ent}$, respectively). Details of the model fitting to multi-band observations 
are illustrated in Appendix \ref{subsec:p15fit}. This model is built on analytical results of 
\citet{Nakar2014}, and $M_{\rm ext}$ includes only mass concentrated around $R_{\rm ext}$. In 
Figure~\ref{fig:envelope}, we show the best-fitting model of $M_{\rm env} = 9.40_{-0.33}^{+0.69}\times 
10^{-2} M_\odot$, $R_{\rm env} =2.69_{-0.16}^{+0.34}\times10^{12}$\,cm (i.e., $38.7_{-2.4}^{+4.9} 
R_\odot$), and first light epoch at phase $t_{\rm fl}= -3.20_{-0.04}^{+0.03}$\,day.

\citet[][hereafter N16]{Nagy2016} modeled emission from the shock heated star by considering 
density profiles consisting of a compact constant-density inner ``core'' and an outer ``shell'' with 
density power law index $n$. Emission of the shell and core are independent of each other. 

As an attempt to fit the whole light curve of AT2019dge, we ignore 
recombination, fix $n=2$, thomson scattering opacity $\kappa=0.2\,{\rm cm^2\,g^{-1}}$, $M_{\rm 
Ni}=0.08\,M_\odot$ and the gamma-ray leakage parameter at $A_\gamma = t_0^2 = 1600\,{\rm day^2}$.

\section{Conclusion}
In this paper we have presented observations and modeling of the fast transient AT2019dge. We 
summarize our primary observational findings below:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Peak absolute magnitude of MB = −dd mag and decline parameter of hah mag.
	\item  Total Nickel and ejecta masses of $M_{\rm Ni} = 0.03 \pm 0.01$ and $Mej = 0.9 \pm 0.3 
	M_\odot$, respectively.
\end{itemize}


Despite the steady increase in the number of events in the class of sub-luminous transients, the total 
number of well-studied events remain still small ($\approx 10$). An all-sky two-day cadence survey 
with ZTF Phase II is ideally positioned to probe this rare population over a sufficiently large volume 
(given the deeper limiting magnitude of ZTF compared to other ongoing time domain surveys) to 
address questions regarding their intrinsic properties such as luminosity functions, spectroscopic 
diversity and ejecta mass distributions of the different sub-types and their volumetric rates. As likely 
tracers of the end points of white dwarfs and massive stars in extreme binary systems, their intrinsic 
rates are not only important from the point of view of understanding these rare transient phenomena 
but also have direct implications for current and future experiments in the field of gravitational wave 
astronomy. With a higher cadence than the nominal 3-day public survey in Phase I, the 2-day cadence 
in $g$ and $r$ bands will be particularly sensitive to the population of fastest transients in the local 
universe, of which only a handful are known, while the two-color coverage will also be a powerful 
diagnostic of the intrinsic color of these events.

To model the early light curve with the P15 model, we fix $\kappa\sim0.2\,{\rm cm^2\, g^{-1}}$ as 
appropriate for a hydrogen-deficient ionized gas, and assign wide flat priors for all model parameters, 
as summarized in Table~\ref{tab:P15priors}. We only include observations up to $\Delta t = 2$\,d in 
the fitting. We found that this particular choice of $\Delta t$ --- 2\,d instead of 1\,d or 3\,d --- in 
general does not affect the final inference for the model parameters. Figure~\ref{fig:pirocorner} shows 
the corner plot of ${\rm lg}R_{\rm ext}$, ${\rm lg}M_{\rm 	ext}$, and $t_\mathrm{fl}$. For clarity, 
$E_{51}$ and $M_{\rm core}$ are excluded as they do not exhibit strong covariance with the 
parameters shown here. We are unable to constrain these two parameters as they are highly 
anti-correlated with each other over a wide range of their priors.

\end{figure}

The maximum a posteriori model is visualized by solid lines in Figure~\ref{fig:piromodel} color-coded in 
different filters. Note that the fitting is not perfect at the UV bands since 
the SED is not exactly a blackbody at peak (see Figure~\ref{fig:seds}). The rising part of the model 
does not match to data due to the ignorance of the density structure of the stellar profile. \todo{Ask 
Tony} Nevertheless, the peak of the light curve is well captured by this model.

%The final spectrum taken was a LRIS spectrum from $+111?$\,days which showed narrow nebular 
%emission lines from the host galaxy but no detectable flux from AT2019dge. 
We use line centers of nebular lines to derive the spectroscopic redshift of the host (Table 
\ref{tab:host}). The mean of all centroids gives $z = 0.0213 \pm 0.0001$.
